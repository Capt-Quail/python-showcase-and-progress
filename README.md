# python-showcase-and-progress
This is a repository to display my Python learning journey, from basics to multi-file projects.

My love for Python is deep and I will display programs that are most likely too basic to care
about, but essential to my development. 

You will also be able to see more substantial and promising projects. Code will be organized 
in folders, sorted by topic, in the main branch. Internal folder comprehensive, with 
accompanying descriptive documentation as needed.
