# Python has a removesuffix() method that works exactly like removeprefix(). 
# Assign the value 'python_notes.txt' to a variable called filename.
# Then use the removesuffix() method to display the filename without the 
# file extension, like some file browsers do.
filename = "python_notes.txt"
print(filename.removesuffix('.txt'))
