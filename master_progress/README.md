The following programs were derived from my self-guided Python learning 
journey while reading No Starch Press's "Python Crash Course." 

I have completed part 1, which is understanding the basics/fundamentals, and
I will now be moving on to the final part 2, major projects. In the meantime, 
I would love to share a comprensive capture of my progress--you are no doubt 
beyond this stage of learning, but hope it is appreciated nonetheless. 

In the proceeding sub-directories you will find a table of contents. Further 
edits may be made to rename my programs to be relative to their repsective 
lesson.
